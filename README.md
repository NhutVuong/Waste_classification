# 🌿 "CÁCH MẠNG XANH CỦA AI" – Smart Waste Classification System

## 📂 Dataset Used  
- <a href="https://github.com/NhutVuong/Waste_classification/blob/main/dataset_organic.zip">Dataset 1: Organic Waste</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/NhutVuong/Waste_classification/blob/main/dataset_recyclable.zip">Dataset 2: Recyclable Waste</a>

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops an **AI-powered waste classification system** that automatically detects and categorizes waste into two main types:  

♻️ **Recyclable Waste** – Paper, plastic, glass, metal, etc.  
🍃 **Organic Waste** – Food scraps, plant-based materials, biodegradable waste.  

By utilizing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system classifies waste in **real-time** using images captured from cameras. This enables efficient waste sorting for **recycling plants** and **waste management systems**, improving accuracy and reducing contamination.

## 🔹 Dataset & Model Training  
✅ **Two Image Datasets** – Collected and labeled as **"Organic"** and **"Recyclable Waste"**.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Image resizing, augmentation, and normalization to enhance model performance.  
✅ **CNN Model Training** – Using **deep learning** to build a highly accurate waste classification model.  
✅ **Real-time Deployment** – Integrating AI-powered sorting into waste management facilities.
